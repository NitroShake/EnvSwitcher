# EnvSwitcher

A version of EnvSwitcher for Firefox.
Enables you to switch between different versions of the same site - local, staging and live.
You can maintain the list of sites, even export and import as CSV.

You need Firefox Developer Edition to use since normal Firefox doesn't allow unsigned extensions (https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/developer/)

Make sure xpinstall.signatures.required is disabled in about:config

Once downloaded, go to about:addons, click the gear at the top, and click "Install Add-on from File..."

You should then get a green leafy icon in your toolbar, you might need to click the jigsaw puzzle icon to see it, then pin it.

Next you just need to add URLs, which you can either add manually, by going to a URL and clicking the add button, or by importing a CSV.
